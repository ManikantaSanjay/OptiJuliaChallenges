### Objective
The goal is to determine if a given array of integers can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sums of elements in both subsets are equal. This problem is modeled as a binary optimization problem using JuMP and the GLPK solver.

### Variables
- **`x[i]` (Binary Variable):** Represents whether the `i`-th element of the array `nums` is included in the subset that is being summed to potentially reach half of the total array sum.

### Preconditions
- **Sum Parity Check:** Before setting up the model, we check if the total sum of the array is even. If it's odd, it's immediately impossible to split the array into two equal sum subsets, and the function returns `false`.

### Constraint
- **Equal Partition Constraint:** The sum of the elements in the subset must equal exactly half of the total sum of the array. This is enforced by the constraint `sum(x[i] * nums[i] for i in 1:length(nums)) == target`, where `target` is half of the total sum of the array `nums`.

### Objective Function
- **Dummy Objective:** Since we're only interested in the feasibility of achieving the target sum, the objective function is set to minimize `0`, effectively turning the problem into a feasibility check rather than optimization.

### Solver Configuration
- **GLPK Solver:** Used for its ability to efficiently solve binary and integer linear programming problems. The solver checks for the existence of at least one solution that satisfies the partition constraint.

### Execution and Result
- The model is optimized using the `optimize!` function. If the solver finds a feasible solution:
  - The function returns `true`, indicating the array can be split into two subsets with equal sums.
  - If no feasible solution exists, it returns `false`, indicating such a partition is not possible.
