### Objective
The objective is to schedule a set of jobs on a set of machines to minimize the maximum completion time of all jobs, often referred to as the makespan. This scheduling problem is modeled using JuMP and solved using the GLPK solver.

### Data Input and Parameters
- **Machines and Jobs:** The problem involves a finite set of machines and jobs, with each job required to be processed on exactly one machine.
- **Processing Times:** Each job has a specific processing time on each machine, represented as a dictionary `T`.

### Variables
- **`x[m, j]` (Binary Variable):** Indicates whether job `j` is assigned to machine `m`.
- **`s[m, j]` (Continuous Variable):** Represents the start time of job `j` on machine `m`.
- **`e[m, j]` (Continuous Variable):** Represents the end time of job `j` on machine `m`.
- **`emax` (Continuous Variable):** Represents the maximum end time among all jobs on all machines.

### Constraints
1. **Job Assignment:**
   - Each job must be assigned to exactly one machine: `sum(x[m, j] for m in machines) == 1` for each job `j`.

2. **Time Linking:**
   - The end time for each job on each machine must respect the start time and processing time: `e[m, j] >= s[m, j] + x[m, j] * T[m, j]`.

3. **Maximum Completion Time:**
   - The maximum end time `emax` must be at least as large as the end time of every job on every machine: `emax >= e[m, j]`.

4. **Sequential Constraints:**
   - Ensures proper sequencing of jobs on machines, such as a job cannot start before the previous job finishes plus a setup time, etc.

5. **Special Constraints:**
   - Certain jobs might have specific machine constraints or dependencies, e.g., `x[2, 2] == 0`.

### Objective Function
- **Minimize the makespan:** `Min, emax`.

### Solver Configuration
- **GLPK Solver:** A solver that handles both linear and integer optimization problems effectively.

### Execution and Visualization
- The model is optimized using the `optimize!` function. After optimization, the start times, durations, and assigned machines for each job are plotted using the Plots package.
- Jobs are represented as colored segments on a Gantt chart, providing a clear visualization of the job scheduling on each machine.
