## Problem Formulation for Leetcode 55: Jump Game

### Objective
The challenge is to determine if it is possible to jump to the last index of the array starting from the first index, where each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. The problem is formulated as an MILP problem using JuMP and the Cbc solver to optimize the decision-making process.

### Variables
- **`x[i]` (Binary Variable):** Represents whether the `i`-th index can be reached (1 if reachable, 0 otherwise).

### Constraints
- **Initial Position:** Ensures that the final index (`n`) is set as reachable (`x[n] == 1`).
- **Reachability Constraints:** For each index `i` from `n-1` to `1`, there is a constraint ensuring that if index `i` is reachable, then at least one of the subsequent indices up to `i + nums[i]` must also be reachable. This ensures that if you can be at index `i`, you can make a jump to subsequent indices within the bounds dictated by `nums[i]`.

### Objective Function
- **Maximize `x[1]`:** The objective function aims to maximize the value of `x[1]`, which means the formulation seeks to make the start index (index 1) reachable. A solution where `x[1] = 1` indicates that it is possible to jump from the first to the last index.

### Solver Configuration
- **Cbc Solver:** A MILP solver used to find a feasible solution that satisfies all constraints. It is chosen for its capability to efficiently handle binary decision problems.

### Execution and Result
- The model is solved using the `optimize!` function. If the solver finds a solution where the first index is reachable (`x[1] = 1`):
  - The function returns `true`, indicating it is possible to jump from the first to the last index.
  - If not, it returns `false`, indicating that jumping to the last index is not feasible.
